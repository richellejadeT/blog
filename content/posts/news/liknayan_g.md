I was recently a guest on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@liknayan.podcast" target="_blank">Liknayan Podcast</a>, which is run by Filipino physicists from all over the world. During the episode, I talked about the research Iâ€™m currently working on and how I ended up studying physics. It was a fun conversation, though I did find it challenging at times to translate science-related terms into Filipino!

## Topics Covered

- [**Data Science**](/tags/data-science): Trying to learn the tools in data science and doing simple projects.
- [**ML**](/tags/ML/): Trying to learn machine learning and doing simple projects.
- [**Physics**](/tags/physics/): Understanding topics in physics through self-studying. This will mainly be for me to motivate myself to finish books/reviews and replicating already known examples to be familiar with some physics packages.
